I hope the assessment results have informed you of your strengths and weaknesses regarding your knowledge of the visual literacy vocabulary. \\r\\nNow what?  \\r\\nWell, to start, the terms and concepts are further discussed on the additional feedback slides, which can be accessed when you review your responses to the items. If you have not done it, please go to the previous slide and access each “REVIEW” button. Meanwhile, a compilation of all the terms and concepts can be found and downloaded on the previous slide. You are recommended to pay special attention to those terms and concepts that did not match your responses. Since these terms and concepts denote the most fundamental knowledge of a visually literate individual, as an instructional designer or aspiring instructional designer who is expected to communicate effectively using the visual form, you should purposefully conduct further visual literacy training and learning based on the results of this assessment. For example, if your responses did not match many concepts in the Visual Actions section, you should emphasize your learning of visual actions, techniques, or principles. \\r\\nNevertheless, keep in mind that this product only assesses whether you can name the term or concept being portrayed in the visuals with the assistance of various cues, such as the verbal cues in each item. Dealing with visuals, especially in workplace where instructional designers are often expected to function as various roles, will not stop at recognizing the terms and concepts but concerns more complex and advanced interactions with visuals, such as applying the visual actions or techniques in specific contexts for unique purposes and evaluating visual messages.  \\r\\nTherefore, over the long term, you are suggested not only to study the terms and concepts but pursue a broader spectrum of visual literacy topics and interests. An example set of standards for higher education visual literacy competencies is provided by the Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL), which highlights skills related to visual decoding and encoding from the perspective of information literacy. As seen in the following list, the standards underline visual information retrieval and ethical use of visuals. \\n\\nDetermine the nature and extent of the visual materials needed \\nFind and access needed images and visual media effectively and efficiently \\nInterpret and analyze the meanings of images and visual media \\nEvaluate images and their sources \\nUse images and visual media effectively \\nDesign and create meaningful images and visual media \\nUnderstand many of the ethical, legal, social, and economic issues surrounding the creation and use of images and visual media, and access and use visual materials ethically  \\r\\n   (ALA, 2011) \\n\\nIt is worth noting that while some of the above competencies might be more relevant to your job as an instructional design professional than others, or there are other competencies related to visuals that are not listed here, the list provides several general directions or content domains for you to consider. Most importantly, if you have not already, you should start to decode and encode visuals for professional and personal uses and to nurture your visual literacy skills intentionally and carefully.  \\r\\nThe following books are great resources to begin this journey. Some of these concern general visual communication while others emphasize visual literacy in instructional design and learning.  \\n\\nCurtiss, D. (1987).
