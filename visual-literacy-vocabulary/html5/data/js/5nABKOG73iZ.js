I hope that the results of the assessment have informed you of your strengths and weaknesses regarding your knowledge of the visual literacy vocabulary.  \\r\\nNow what?   \\r\\nWell, to start, the terms and concepts are further discussed on the additional feedback slides, which can be accessed as you review individual items. If you have not already done so, please feel free to go to the previous slide and access each of the “REVIEW” buttons. Meanwhile, a compilation of all the terms and concepts can be found and downloaded on the previous slide. You are recommended to pay particular attention to those terms and concepts that did not match your responses. Since these terms and concepts denote the most fundamental knowledge of a visually literate individual, as an instructional designer or aspiring instructional designer who is expected to communicate effectively using the visual form, you may purposefully pursue further visual literacy training and learning based on the results of this assessment.. For example, if your responses did not match many of the concepts in the Visual Actions section, you may emphasize your learning of visual actions, techniques, or principles.  \\r\\nThat said, keep in mind that this product only assesses whether you can name the term or concept being portrayed in the visuals with the assistance of various cues, such as the verbal cues in each item. Dealing with visuals, especially in the workplace where instructional designers are often expected to play a variety of roles, does not stop at recognizing terms and concepts, but involves more complex and advanced interactions with visuals, such as applying the visual actions or techniques in specific contexts for unique purposes and evaluating visual messages.   \\r\\nTherefore, in the long run, I recommend that you not only study the terms and concepts, but also pursue a broader spectrum of visual literacy topics and interests. The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) provides an example set of standards for higher education visual literacy competencies that emphasize skills related to visual decoding and encoding from an information literacy perspective. As can be seen in the following list, the standards address visual information retrieval and ethical use of visuals, which is not commonly found in other lists.\\n\\nDetermine the nature and extent of the visual materials needed \\nFind and access needed images and visual media effectively and efficiently \\nInterpret and analyze the meanings of images and visual media \\nEvaluate images and their sources \\nUse images and visual media effectively \\nDesign and create meaningful images and visual media \\nUnderstand many of the ethical, legal, social, and economic issues surrounding the creation and use of images and visual media, and access and use visual materials ethically  \\r\\n   (The Visual Literacy Standards Task Force, 2012) \\n\\nIt is worth noting that while some of the above competencies might be better suited to your job as an instructional design professional than others, or there are other visual competencies not listed here, the list provides several general directions or content domains for you to consider. Most importantly, if you have not already, you should begin decoding and encoding visuals for professional and intentionally and carefully developing your visual literacy skills.   \\r\\nThe following books are great resources to begin this journey. Some of these concern general visual communication, while others emphasize visual literacy in instructional design and learning.   \\n\\nCurtiss, D. (1987).
